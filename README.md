# Florida
  This is a website project I am working on it is meant to be a database of many of the springs in Florida. The purpose of this is to help people find springs in their area and encourage them to go to the springs. I believe that if people become interested in nature they will actively try to perserve it.
  I plan to implemnt a few more features in the future include a google map with all the springs marked on the map.
  Unfortunately github pages does not support a back end so it is currently not possible to view any data in the database. The Database is on my local machine I am currently looking for cost effective and secure server to support my database so I can publish the complete website. You can view the PHP code in the repository however you will not be able to see how it works on the live site.
  the link to the site is:
